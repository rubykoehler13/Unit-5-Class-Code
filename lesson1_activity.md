# Lesson 1 Activity

Write a program that will give suggested footwear based on the weather.

Ask the user for the weather outside with three options (sunny, rainy, or snowy) and give the correct footwear suggestion (sandals, galoshes, or boots). 

*Each option should be written as its own function that prints a message based on the input.*

For example, if the following input was given:

```What is the weather? (sunny, rainy, snowy): rainy```

The following output should be given:

```On a rainy day, galoshes are appropriate footwear.```

Note: Be sure to print a notice if an invalid option was chosen!
